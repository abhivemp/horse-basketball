# horse-basketball
A common street basketball game is HORSE, where a set of players compete to make particular shots. This is a simple tracking application

## Implementation

To make my code implementation easier, I have designed a circular singly linked list. Each node would hold the player name, followed by their score. For this, I have built the custom data structure to suit the requirements for this project. 


## UPDATES 

This section will be updated as the project progress.

Currently designing the data structure. Built the `add()` method. Currently debugging `print()` and `remove()`.
